# platform-docker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mglaman/platform-docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mglaman/platform-docker)

**Platform Docker** is a CLI tool for scaffolding docker-compose configuration for PHP projects, currently opinionated at PHP projects. Running ````platform-docker````
in a directory will create a multi-container application environment for local development.

Currently support is focused at Drupal 7 and Drupal 8. However there is rudimentary WordPress support. Generic PHP applications should be easy to implement.

## Requirements

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Optional
composer global require hirak/prestissimo:^0.3

## Installation
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
add address=/platform/127.0.0.1 to /etc/dnsmasq.conf

First, if you do not have Docker then head over to their [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/) and see how to install for your machine.
For OSX and Windows users, make sure you have [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed and docker-machine configured, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/#/create-a-machine) for the later and ensure you have
ran `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default`.

````
composer global require mglaman/platform-docker
````

## Usage

Use within any directory. Until the app itself can scaffold a folder, it's expecting a folder structure of

* /shared (if not present it will be made)
* /www (required, this is your build)
* /repository (not required, but opinionated this is the source of what was built.)
* /tests (default directory it will look for Behat tests, however checks shared and www)

Sites are provisioned at *project-name*.platform. Currently the tld is not configurable (#24). It's best to set up dnsmasq set up wildcard DNS entries to point \*.platform to your localhost or Docker VM (Mac, Windows.) Here's some tutorials
# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
edit /etc/dnsma

If you are on Mac OS X, export ````PLATFORM_DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME```` with your Docker machine name. The tool will automatically boot the machine or export its environment information as needed. For example, put ````12 export PLATFORM_DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="vmname"```` in your .bash_profile.

### Features

#### Redis
There is a redis container available. Currently it can be added by adding the following to .platform-project in the root directory of the project

````
services:
  - redis
`````

#### Solr
An Apache Solr container is available with the default server URI is ````http://solr:8983/solr```` Currently it can be added by adding the following to .platform-project in the root directory of the project

````
services:
  - solr
`````

#### Flamegraphs
There is a helper command which patches Drupal to log xhprof items, and then turn them into a flamegraph.

#### Behat tests
Searches for behat.yml files, laucnches a Selenium (Firefox) container and executes tests.
